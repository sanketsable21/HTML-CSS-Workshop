        Holi, the festival of colors 🎨, is one of the most vibrant and joyous celebrations in India 🇮🇳. It marks the
        arrival of spring 🌸 and symbolizes the victory of good over evil 🔥. People celebrate Holi by smearing colors
        on each other 🎭, dancing 💃, singing 🎶, and enjoying festive sweets like gujiya 🥟 and thandai 🥛. The
        festival begins with Holika Dahan 🔥, where bonfires are lit to signify the burning away of negativity. The next
        day, people come together to play with colors 🌈, forgetting differences and strengthening bonds of love and
        friendship ❤️🤗. Holi is not just a festival; it is an expression of joy 😃, unity 🤝, and the spirit of
        togetherness 🎊.
