        -HTML(Structure)
        <pre>
    --> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages.It provides the basic structure of a webpage using elements enclosed in tags. HTML 
        works alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. Every HTMLdocument begins with a `DOCTYPE html` declaration, followed by the html`element, which contains 
        the `head` and `body` sections. The `head` section includes metadata,the page title, and links to stylesheets, while the `body` section contains the main content, such as 
        headings, paragraphs,images, links, and other elements. HTML uses a hierarchical structure with nested tags to organize content. It is not a programming language but a markup language
        that defines the structure of a webpage, making it essential for web development.
        </pre>
        <br>
        -CSS(Design)
        <pre>
    --> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements. It allows web developers to style web pages by applying colors, 
        fonts, spacing, and positioning to elements. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them using properties and values. There are three ways to use CSS: 
        inline (within an HTML element using the `style` attribute), internal (within a `style` tag inside the `head` section), and external (linking a separate CSS file using the 
        `link` tag). CSS follows a cascading rule, meaning styles are applied in a priority order based on specificity and inheritance. It plays a crucial role in making web pages 
        visually appealing and responsive across different screen sizes.

        -JavaScript(Functionality / Logic Building)
        <pre>
    --> JavaScript is a powerful programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It runs in the browser and allows developers to add functionality such as 
        animations, form validation, pop-ups, and interactive elements. JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS, where HTML provides the structure, CSS handles styling, and 
        JavaScript manages interactivity. It can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), enabling real-time updates to webpage content without requiring a reload. JavaScript 
        supports variables, functions, loops, and event handling, making it essential for modern web development. It can be used both on the client side (in the browser) and 
        server side (with Node.js). Due to its versatility and widespread adoption, JavaScript is one of the most important languages for building web applications.
        </pre>
        <br>
        -JQuery(Write less & do more)
        <pre>
    --> jQuery is a fast, lightweight JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML document manipulation, event handling, animations, and AJAX interactions. It allows developers 
        to write less code while achieving the same functionality as vanilla JavaScript. With jQuery, tasks like selecting elements, modifying content, handling events, and creating 
        animations become much easier. It uses a simple syntax, often starting with the `$` symbol, to select and manipulate elements efficiently. For example, `$("#element").hide();`
        hides an element with the ID "element" instantly. jQuery also provides cross-browser compatibility, ensuring consistent behavior across different web browsers. While modern 
        JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue have reduced the need for jQuery, it is still widely used in many projects due to its simplicity and reliability.
        </pre>
        <br>
        -Bootstrap(CSS + JavaScript)
        <pre>
    --> Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework used to create responsive and mobile-friendly websites quickly. It provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and 
        JavaScript components, such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, and modals, making web development faster and more efficient. Bootstrap uses a grid system that helps developers 
        design flexible and adaptive layouts that adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes. It also includes built-in support for typography, colors, and utility classes, reducing 
        the need for custom CSS. The framework is easy to integrate with existing projects and is widely used for developing modern, visually appealing web applications. Bootstrap simplifies 
        web design, allowing developers to focus on functionality rather than spending time on styling from scratch.
        </pre>
        <br>
        -Ajax
        <pre>
    --> AJAX is a web development technique that allows webpages to send and receive data from a server asynchronously without reloading the entire page. It improves user experience by enabling 
        real-time updates, such as live search, form submission, and content loading without refreshing. AJAX works by using the XMLHttpRequest object or the newer fetch() API to communicate with 
        the server. Although "XML" is in its name, modern applications often use JSON instead of XML for data exchange.
        </pre>
        <br>
        -JSON
        <pre>
    --> JSON is a lightweight data format used for storing and exchanging data between a server and a web application. It is easy to read and write, making it a popular choice for APIs and data 
        transmission. JSON is structured as key-value pairs, similar to JavaScript objects, and supports data types like strings, numbers, arrays, and nested objects.
        </pre>
        <br>
        -Git
        <pre>
    --> Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently by managing 
        different versions of code. Git stores project history, enables branching for feature development, and helps in merging changes seamlessly. Developers use Git to track modifications, 
        revert to previous versions, and maintain a structured workflow. Commands like git init, git add, git commit, git push, and git pull are commonly used to manage code changes.
        </pre>
        <br>
        -Github
        <pre>
    --> GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and enables developers to collaborate on projects. It provides features like pull requests, issue tracking, and code reviews, 
        making teamwork more efficient. GitHub allows developers to store their code publicly or privately and provides integration with CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment. By using 
        GitHub, developers can contribute to open-source projects, showcase their work, and maintain version-controlled repositories accessible from anywhere.

    -ReactJS
    <pre>
    --> ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library used for building fast and interactive user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, it follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is broken down into 
        reusable components. React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to update web pages efficiently, improving performance by rendering only the necessary parts of the UI.
    --> React applications are typically written using JSX (JavaScript XML), which allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It also supports state management, making it easier to handle 
        dynamic data and user interactions. React can be used for both single-page applications (SPAs) and complex web applications, and it integrates well with other libraries and frameworks.
